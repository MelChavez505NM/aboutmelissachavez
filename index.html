<h1>Wannabe Web Developer</h1>
<P>-Originally from New Mexico. 505 POR VIDA!</p>
<p>-Love to cook and eat good food from around the world. Yummy pasta from Italy is the absolute fav by far tho!</p>
<p>-Enjoy traveling to other countries when she can. Next stop is London, England!</p>

<p>-Will work hard to learn to code. And will work hard not to loose my mind in the process!</p>
<p>-Further, I love New Mexico for the sunsets. Sunrises are nice too, if I'm not sleeping in!</p>
<p>-Plan to get a dog when life is not so hectic. Who am I kidding, there is never a right time, getting the puppy now!</p>
